# Personal Learning

This repository is made for me to learn different concepts and coding skills.

The repository consist of several subprojects written in different languages:

1. [C++](#cpp)
2. [Python](#python)
3. [R](#r)
4. [Bash](#bash)

Some projects have been part of courses others are spare time projects.

Feel free to look around!
